/*
 * Animations — Our Cookbook
 * =========================
 * Entrance animations, hover transitions, and motion.
 *
 * The cards use a staggered entrance animation — each card fades in
 * slightly after the previous one, like being dealt from a deck.
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS:
 * 1. Cards start invisible (opacity: 0) and shifted down
 * 2. The @keyframes 'cardEntrance' animates them into place
 * 3. Each card uses animation-delay to stagger the timing
 *    (set inline in the HTML with style="--i: 0", --i: 1, etc.)

  /* Each card delays based on its --i custom property */

    opacity: 0;

/* ── Reduced motion ──
 * Some people get motion sick from animations.
 * This media query disables them for users who've asked for less motion.
